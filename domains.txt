As all the other answers say, 150^53 is too big a number for C/C++ to handle. 
But it seems that you need to calculate ( 150^53 ) mod 10.  ( mod = remainder )
Ever heard of Fermat's little theorem ?
You can use it here. 
if you want to calculate (a^b) % x, 
can you say, (a^b) % x = { (a%x)^b } % x ?
If you can, then you see that a%x will be a small number. In your case, 150%10 = 0. And hence the answer is 0. 
Furthermore,  a^b = a*a^(b-1)
( a^b )%x = { (a%x) * { ( a^(b-1) )%x } } % x
You can use this to further simplify the calculation of { (a%x)^b } % x.
